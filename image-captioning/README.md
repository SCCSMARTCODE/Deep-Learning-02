# **Image Captioning with Deep Learning**

### **Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of an **Image Captioning** model that generates descriptive captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation. The project is built and trained on publicly available datasets and demonstrates robust captioning despite limited computational resources.

---

### **Features**
- Implements an Encoder-Decoder architecture:
  - **Encoder**: A pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet) extracts image features.
  - **Decoder**: An RNN (LSTM) generates captions from the features.
- Supports teacher forcing for efficient training.
- Utilizes techniques such as padding and masking to handle variable-length captions.
- BLEU scores are used to evaluate caption quality.

---

### **Architecture**
1. **Encoder**: 
   - Pre-trained CNN extracts spatial and semantic features from images.
2. **Decoder**: 
   - Embedding layer for input captions.
   - LSTM layers for sequence generation.
   - Fully connected layer for vocabulary mapping.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, torchvision
- **Libraries**: Matplotlib, NLTK
- **Tools**: Kaggle for dataset hosting, W&B for model tracking

### **Dataset**
The project uses the **Flickr8k** dataset for training and validation. Each image is paired with multiple human-annotated captions, providing a robust basis for training and evaluation.

---

### **Evaluation**
- **BLEU Score**: Measures the quality of generated captions by comparing them to human-annotated references.
- **Visualization**: Captions are visualized alongside their corresponding images for qualitative analysis.

### **Results**
- Example generated captions:
  | Image                           | Predicted Caption                   |
  |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | ![sample](path/to/image1.jpg)   | A man riding a bicycle on a street. |
  | ![sample](path/to/image2.jpg)   | A dog playing with a ball.          |

### **Future Improvements**
- Incorporate Transformer-based architectures like ViT and GPT for enhanced captioning.
- Fine-tune pre-trained models on larger datasets.
- Add multilingual caption generation capabilities.
